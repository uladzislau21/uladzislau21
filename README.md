## Welcome to my GitHub profile. Thank you for checking it out 👋🇼‌🇪‌🇱‌🇨‌🇴‌🇲‌🇪‌😎

I am molecular biologist with more than 5 years wet lab research experience. Now I expand my expertise with Data Science experience. My goal is to connect biology with data science to gain more deeper understanding of the data. Namely, I am interested in application of cutting-edge data analysis methods as well as machine learning to proteomics data. My goal is to develop as Data Scientist to create new or improve current data analysis strategies in proteomics.
